# ACC Broadcasting Client for Dart/Flutter

Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC) is a motor racing simulator that replicates the primary GT racing series, including GT2. GT3, GT4 and a couple of car specific racing series including Porsche Cup. 
There are many online leagues that use the sim and many of them choose to stream their races from a separate instance of the game.  To facilitate this broadcasting, ACC provides a UDP interface that provides data regarding the state of the game and supports commands for controlling the current view.

This Dart library provides components and services that all applications written in Dart to connect to the ACC Broadcasting API, comsume the data it produces via events and control the camera and HUD view.
